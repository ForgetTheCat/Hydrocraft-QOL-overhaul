# Hydrocraft-QOL-overhaul
HC Forgetthecat small fixes.

The main goal is to equalize the visual component of the Hydrocraft mod with the original game [41.74]. At the moment, fix supplements all recipes, kitchen books, skill books, all types of magazines, drinks in soda bottles, juices in carton boxes, milk, energy drinks, juices in plastic bottles, ice cream. Added animations, sounds, items added to vanilla recipes, almost all items can be put on the surface (using a 3D model).

- All the literature of the mod is adjacent to the original model and animation has been added. Suitable covers were used for kitchen, electric, mechanics, comic, adult
	etc magazines and Cooking books;
	+ recipe books are reworked in the same way. I tried to choose the right color for the type of material. Example: a book of "Stone works" is greyish, "Electricity" is Yellow etc;
	+ different levels of entertainment magazines gives different values of effect;
	+ pack of pasteurized milk and canisters with milk now use in-game models and textures aswell as "RedBull" and "POWER" energy drinks;
	+ added some recipes to milk drinks/food and chocolate.
